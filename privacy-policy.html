    <h1>Privacy Policy – YUS (Yelloh Bus)</h1>
    <p class="date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 07/01/2026</p>

    <p>
      YUS (Yelloh Bus) is a real-time college bus tracking ecosystem designed to
      provide accurate, reliable, and efficient transportation information for
      students, staff, parents, drivers, administrators, and the public.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, stored,
      and protected across the YUS ecosystem. By using any YUS application or
      service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all components of the YUS ecosystem,
      including Yelloh Bus (Passenger Mobile Application), YUS Driver (Driver
      Mobile Application), YUS Route (Admin Mobile Application), YUS Admin (Web
      Application), and the YUS website.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Passenger Application (Yelloh Bus)</strong></p>
    <p>
      We prioritize passenger privacy. No registration or personal information
      is required to use Yelloh Bus. The app does not access the passenger’s
      location. Live bus location updates are received only via WebSocket while
      the app is in the foreground. When the app goes to the background, the
      WebSocket connection is automatically disconnected. Passengers can track
      buses completely anonymously.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Driver Application (YUS Driver)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The YUS Driver app is used for operational tracking and safety. It collects
      driver identification details provided by administrators, login and
      session data, assigned bus and route information, and live GPS location
      during trips. Background location access is necessary to ensure
      uninterrupted real-time bus tracking even when the driver’s phone is
      locked. Location sharing occurs only when the driver explicitly starts
      sharing.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Route Management and Administrative Systems</strong></p>
    <p>
      YUS Route and YUS Admin may collect GPS coordinates and route metadata
      during route creation and operational scheduling. This information is used
      exclusively for defining accurate bus routes and managing daily
      operations. Access is restricted to authorized administrative personnel
      only.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Information collected by YUS is used solely to provide real-time bus
      tracking, calculate accurate ETAs for bus stops, manage routes, buses, and
      drivers, enable daily scheduling and operational control, and maintain
      system reliability and security. YUS does not use information for
      advertising, marketing, or profiling purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      YUS does not sell, rent, or trade personal data. Driver location data is
      shared internally within the YUS ecosystem to enable live tracking for
      passengers. Data is shared only when required to provide system
      functionality and is not disclosed to third parties outside the YUS
      ecosystem without explicit consent, except as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All information collected by YUS is stored securely using industry-standard
      technologies. Reasonable technical and organizational measures are
      implemented to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of
      data. Only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Account Creation and Deletion</h2>
    <p><strong>Driver Accounts</strong></p>
    <p>
      Drivers cannot self-register. Accounts are created only by administrators.
      Drivers may request account deletion through the YUS Driver app. Requests
      are sent to the backend server and reviewed by administrators. Accounts are
      safely deactivated within a few days of approval.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Passenger Accounts</strong></p>
    <p>
      No passenger accounts are created, and therefore no deletion requests are
      necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Driver location data is retained only for operational purposes. Once a
      driver account is deactivated, location sharing stops immediately. Cached
      and session data are periodically cleared to maintain system efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      YUS is intended for college transportation systems and is not designed for
      children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data
      from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. User Support and Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      Passengers, drivers, or administrators may report issues, provide
      feedback, or ask questions by contacting
      <strong>yusofficialteam@gmail.com</strong>.
      All inquiries are reviewed and addressed by the YUS administrative team.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of YUS
      services after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
